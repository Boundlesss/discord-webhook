# discord-webhook
Here is a small little example of how you can interact with Discord Webhook's using NodeJS.

### Requirements
* NodeJS (Of course)
* Installation of "request" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
* Basic knowledge of Javascript

### How to do
1. Create a new folder, and using command prompt (or Powershell), type `npm-init`.
2. Going through each prompt, at the end, type `yes` and it should create a new file called `package.json`
3. In the terminal, now type `npm install request --save` and just wait for it to finish installing the package.
4. Once finished, create a new file in the same directory called `app.js` and another called `config.json`
5. Copy the `config.json` and `app.js` from this github repository and paste it into the corresponding files in your directory.
6. Edit your `config.json` to your liking, and then just type `node .` in your terminal and it should run!

#### Quick tip: If you have set it to loop and don't know how to stop it, hit `CTRL + C` at the same time.

Sorry if the explaination wasn't the best, but eh, hoped you at least know how to setup!

That is all you really need! Just edit the config to your requirements and then you can use it! (I will add embed's soon!).
It is extremely simple, and just put this here because I may use it soon.
