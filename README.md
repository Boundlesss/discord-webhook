# discord-webhook
Here is a small little example of how you can interact with Discord Webhook's using NodeJS.

### Requirements
1. NodeJS (Of course)
2. Installation of "request" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
3. Basic knowledge of Javascript

That is all you really need! Just edit the config to your requirements and then you can use it! (I will add embed's soon!).
It is extremely simple, and just put this here because I may use it soon.
